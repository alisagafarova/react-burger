# Stellar Burgers Project 🍔✨

The Stellar Burgers application is a space-themed burger shop project, developed as part of the **Yandex Practicum** course to apply practical knowledge in React and frontend development.

This project is shared **for learning and demonstration purposes**. The original learning API is no longer available, and I am exploring ways to recreate it for full project demonstration.

### ⚠️ Note about API

The project originally used a temporary learning API, which is **no longer accessible**.  
This repository is kept for **frontend demonstration and learning purposes**.  
I am currently exploring ways to **recreate the API locally** so the project can be fully functional again.

For now, you can still explore the **React structure, Redux flow, components, and UI behavior** using mock data.
